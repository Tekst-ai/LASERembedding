# LASER embeddings v2   
[![CI-LASER](https://github.com/Tekst-ai/LASERembedding/actions/workflows/laser.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Tekst-ai/LASERembedding/actions/workflows/laser.yml)


is a python package that makes the new LASER models of [Facebook Research's NNLB](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER/tree/main/nllb) (no language left behind) 
easy installable and ready to use.

The original version had a lot of extra dependencies and is hard to install.

**CURRENT VERSION:**
* We now provide updated LASER models which support over 200 languages. Please see [here](nllb/README.md) for more details including how to download the models and perform inference.

According to our experience, the sentence encoder also supports code-switching, i.e.
the same sentences can contain words in several different languages.

We have also some evidence that the encoder can generalize to other
languages which have not been seen during training, but which are in
a language family which is covered by other languages.

A detailed description of how the multilingual sentence embeddings are trained can
be found in [10], together with an experimental evaluation.

## Installation
* download encoders from Amazon s3 by e.g. `bash download_models.sh` 
  * This downloads all the LASER files to /models folder
* download third party software by `bash ./install_external_tools.sh`
* download the data used in the example tasks (see description for each task)

## Applications

We showcase several applications of multilingual sentence embeddings
with code to reproduce our results (in the directory "tasks").

* [**Cross-lingual document classification**](tasks/mldoc) using the
  [*MLDoc*](https://github.com/facebookresearch/MLDoc) corpus [2,6]
* [**WikiMatrix**](tasks/WikiMatrix)
   Mining 135M Parallel Sentences in 1620 Language Pairs from Wikipedia [7]
* [**Bitext mining**](tasks/bucc) using the
  [*BUCC*](https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2018/bucc2018-task.html) corpus [3,5]
* [**Cross-lingual NLI**](tasks/xnli)
  using the [*XNLI*](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/xnli/) corpus [4,5,6]
* [**Multilingual similarity search**](tasks/similarity) [1,6]
* [**Sentence embedding of text files**](tasks/embed)
  example how to calculate sentence embeddings for arbitrary text files in any of the supported language.

**For all tasks, we use exactly the same multilingual encoder, without any task specific optimization or fine-tuning.**

## Supported languages

The original LASER model was trained on the following languages:

Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Aymara, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali,
Berber languages, Bosnian, Breton, Bulgarian, Burmese, Catalan, Central/Kadazan Dusun, Central Khmer,
Chavacano, Chinese, Coastal Kadazan, Cornish, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Eastern Mari, English,
Esperanto, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, Georgian, German, Greek, Hausa, Hebrew, Hindi,
Hungarian, Icelandic, Ido, Indonesian, Interlingua, Interlingue, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Kabyle,
Kazakh, Korean, Kurdish, Latvian, Latin, Lingua Franca Nova, Lithuanian, Low German/Saxon,
Macedonian, Malagasy, Malay, Malayalam, Maldivian (Divehi), Marathi, Norwegian (Bokm√•l), Occitan,
Persian (Farsi), Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sindhi, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian,
Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tajik, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Uighur,
Ukrainian, Urdu, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Wu Chinese and Yue Chinese.

We have also observed that the model seems to generalize well to other (minority) languages or dialects, e.g.

Asturian, Egyptian Arabic, Faroese, Kashubian, North Moluccan Malay, Nynorsk Norwegian, Piedmontese, Sorbian, Swabian,
Swiss German or Western Frisian.

### LASER3

Updated LASER models referred to as *[LASER3](nllb/README.md)* supplement the above list with support for 147 languages. The full list of supported languages can be seen [here](nllb/README.md#list-of-available-laser3-encoders).
