What food don't you like?
Will you show me the book?

Do you remember how we met?
The worst of it has already happened.
Tom stepped back from the blackboard.
We don't have to starve.

We've made a decision.
Why didn't you write to me right away?
We'll notify him.

I'm easily influenced.
It's always cheaper in the end to buy the best.
I received a coded message from Tom this morning.
When did you translate this letter?
Is this wine from Argentina?
If you speak French, I won't understand.
I know Portuguese, English, and Russian.
Tom's response was immediate.
I ran into Mary at the party last week.
She went inside her room so she could rest.
The woman is young.
We must get up at dawn.
I had a telephone call from her.
You did not make a single mistake? That had to be blind luck!
Is there anyone in the room?
You're lucky Tom didn't come.
I'd like to try this.
I didn't go.
Leave it be, Tom.
Please follow the school rules.
Tom seems stressed.
The ship slowly started to move.

Is it far from here?
It was very difficult.
He picked up a mirror and looked at his tongue.
Have you ever listened to this song?
You're not crazy.
Where is the elevator?
I am not concerned with it.
What's up with you and Tom?
My father ought to have had an operation for cancer.
It grew dark, and what was worse, we lost our way.
It never occurred to me that Tom might not be telling the truth.
Your lives will be spared.
Are you going to invite her to the party?
I saw him looking at me.
He knows other and easier ways of getting what he desires.
I didn't break in.
There's lots of people at the park.
How did you learn German?
We need to put a stop to this now.
I want to visit the Philippines.

Tom wants evidence.
Nobody wanted to mention my country.
Tom reads a lot.
You need to help us.
I never touch beer.
Tom gave me the chicken pox.
Don't tell her you're lost.
What did you think of Tom?
You should be helping Tom.
How do we know it isn't a trap?
He makes a lot more money than I do.
I'll sing today.
We haven't seen him.
Tom is usually the first to get here.
Mary says she doesn't remember anything.
Nobody's that good.
Make sure you do that again.

No one trusts him any more.
You can't hurt me anymore.
I need to get there soon by any means.
People are getting scared.
Tom knows nothing about this matter.
Tom said he wanted to be early.
This isn't going to end well!
We can't protect him.
What time is it now by your watch?

They weren't listening.
We don't know for sure.
I'm waiting for you.
We will consider this.
What products are currently on sale?
She peeled a potato.
How did you know Tom was good at golf?
I'm not sure you'll have the time to do that.

The room was empty for quite a while.

Are you going to the class reunion?
You drink tea.
I want to give them this.
The situation worries me very much.

I think that he is right.
I shall never tell it to anybody.
Tell me again why you like Tom.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
I've got to find something to do after I retire.
You want to leave here, don't you?
I think this is perfect.
Tom said you like to watch horror movies.
Try to get here on time tomorrow.
If I could live again, I would like to be a musician.
If only he had been there.
Where exactly is she?
I had to wait until Tom was asleep.
Can we talk a second?
Mary is respected by everyone.
I can depend on Tom.
She had a little round object in her hand.
Don't let her drive your car.
You still need help.
Tom didn't have much water to drink.
There are plans to build a power plant right here.
I wanted to see you tonight.
It's up to you to decide whether we'll go there or not.
I don't know how things were a hundred or fifty years ago.
Let's dine out for a change.
Drink and eat.
I wonder why Tom is so angry.
I had no idea who she was.
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
The flood was the greatest disaster they had ever had.
I'd have to be an idiot to do that.

Please excuse my bad handwriting.
Tom didn't have any money, so he couldn't buy any food.

Tom says that won't happen.
Tom wasn't the first one to be eliminated.
She is more beautiful than any other girl.
Let us help one another.
What made her so angry?
You fixed it.
I think I know why Tom isn't here.
This wall feels cold.
This is all I need.
Tom drank too much wine.
You bought a coat yesterday, didn't you?
No one can move the big box.
Where's your wife?
I thought Tom wasn't very good at French.
I don't like living alone.
Tom isn't your average guy. He doesn't like things most guys like and he doesn't like to do things most men enjoy doing.
I just hope nothing goes wrong this time.
We have nothing to complain about.
We'll see you there.
I want you to guess.
Tom is going to try to talk to Mary about that today.
Human intervention in nature has no limits.
I'm going to stay here and watch TV.

I'm tired of waiting to do all the things I want to do.
What happened to you last night?
I have a nosebleed.
He's a nerd.
Is it true that you brought your dog to the office?

What can Tom do to help?

Let's go and find Tom.
Tom coughed again.
Someone waits for me.
Tom acted like he owned the place.
You look rather tired.
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Music is a part of me.
It is estimated that a great number of his inventions remain unknown to date.
Tom shouldn't have said that.
The police are not here to arrest you.
I don't know her.
She is a very refined lady.
I was ready for it.
They won't know.

Stop complaining and do as you're told.
What should be done?
Are you listening, Tom?
Where are you guys heading now?
What did you say your name was again?
Success! Soon, anybody can start learning Klingon!
Wherever you may go, you'll be welcomed.
Don't worry about others.
We have a dog.
Let's start right away.
I'm going to leave the three of you alone.
I lost my driver's license.
Recently, everything seems boring to me.
She was similar to me in many ways.
She knocked on the door.
I don’t want to talk about music.
I just wanted to keep things simple.
I'd like to say it's been fun working here, but it hasn't.
I want you to be better.
I love his son.
Are you in Australia?
Just a moment - there's someone at the door.
Tom probably doesn't care.
Tom took his dog for a walk.
That patient may die at any time.
You may get it free of charge.

Did you hear that, Mike?

And if I lose thy love, I lose my all.
I'm a little behind schedule.

I am 24 years old.
Is he satisfied with his daily life?
I only went there once.
I don't know how much longer it'll take.
I think it's a little too cold to go on a picnic.
I'll take my chance.
Tell me where the wine is.
The light became weaker and weaker.
Eat, or else it will go cold.
I saw you kissing him.
Let me think for just a second.
You make me laugh.

Why is everybody in here?
No doubt she will come soon.
Is this book Takeo's?
I can't put up with that noise.
This medicine may cure him.

I just want you to be happy.
I owe a lot of money.
Every day was exhausting.
I had my house painted.
Hurry up, and you will be in time for the bus.
You don't know what it is, do you?
Let's just try it. Who cares what happens afterward? There's no sense thinking too much about that.
Because of hunger and fatigue, the dog finally died.
It is next to impossible to make him stop smoking.

We will survive with God's help!
Tom couldn't bear the pain any more so he shot himself.
This kind of wood is tough to saw through.
Life is strange.

Are you sure you have enough money?
We'll always be here.
I like Tom better.
Tom has family problems.
We must make sure that Tom doesn't hurt himself.

You can't hide the fact from her.
That's the choice we made.
I'm assuming this is your father.
Tom says he'll never do that again.
I live near a dam.
Since my mother was sick, I couldn't go to the concert.
If he'd been alone at that time, he'd have died.

Why do you care so much?
I was very skeptical.

Do I need dentures?
They're really cool.
Do you want to speak privately?
If you do that, Tom will be happy.
We never lock our doors around here.
Australia isn't Austria.

There's only two days left.
Nobody does that.
No one does that.

Did Tom tell you?
I'm the one who rescued you.
I want to help her, but I don't know how.
The engine won't start.
Are you gay?
Tom did it voluntarily.
He murders English.
He's all by himself.
He is not the shy boy he used to be.
You've neither written nor phoned.
I don't want to go with her.
Why do you ask me of all people?
Having knowledge of many languages is an advantage in the contemporary world.
I had some help.
Let's not talk about my problems.
Don't disturb us.

This is what I bought in Spain.
The office is full of competent people.

Tom sat at the bar, just staring at his drink.
I've got to stop you.

This matter doesn't concern you.
I shouldn't be too late.
Please come to meet me at the station.
I ate too much food yesterday.
I can't live without a TV.
I really do want to get to know you better.

Am I late?

Tom told Mary he had to go home early.
Some people think Mary was poisoned.
It's getting harder.
I have an exam tomorrow.
I recognized your voice right away.
There was a lot of students absent from class today.

Most schools were designed not to transform society, but to reproduce it.
You won't find anyone who'll do that for you.
Please, forgive me.
No doubt he will come later.

You shouldn't be jealous.

I do not know.
You are ill.
He was made to wait at the station for two hours.
I'm not chicken.
He is not a physician.
He got arrested.
They arrested her.
They bother me.
Nobody called him.
Don't tell him.
I think you're all wrong.
I wonder why Tom told me to do that.
Put the chair in front of the desk.
I know that feeling, too.
How can I see you?
The women are very supportive.
Who is that woman?
He managed to get himself promoted last week.
Who's that woman?

Do you really think Tom will want to go with us?
Who's this message for?
